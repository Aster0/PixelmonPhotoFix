**TESTED ON PIXELMON 9.2.6**

Currently in the latest version of Pixelmon, wearing a captured photo on your head crashes your game. If other players happen to be in your chunk, they will crash too whilst trying to render the photo above your head. It also crashes your game if you try to go third person mode, open an inventory with a player renderer, or enter a Pixelmon Battle (because it forces you into third person).

This sidemod fixes it using Mixins to force photos to not render. This is a client side mod, does not need to be installed on a server.

Good to include in modpacks, as other players can crash other players on purpose just by wearing the photo item.
